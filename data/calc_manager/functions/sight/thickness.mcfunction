### Note: Limit of Distance is 153.6m. Limit of Resolution is 0.5m.

### Usage: execute as [Source] at [Destination] run function this
### Example: If you want to check the path between a player and an entity, run below.
### execute as @p at @e[tag=X,limit=1] anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^ anchored feet run function <this>
### Returns: $Result BlockThickness == 0 when [Source] can sight on [Destination]
###                                 >= 1 when there are more than 0.1 block between [Source] and [Destination]
