### Usage: execute as [Source] at [Destination] run function this
### Example: If you want to check the path between a player and an entity, run below.
### execute as @p at @e[tag=X,limit=1] anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^ anchored feet run function <this>
### Returns: $CanSight Global == 0 when [Source] can sight on [Destination]
###                           == 1 when [Source] cannot sight on [Destination]
